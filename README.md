Weather distribution analysis involves the collection and statistical modeling of weather data to understand patterns and predict future weather events. The methodology includes:

Data Collection: Using weather stations, satellites, and models to gather data on temperature, precipitation, wind speed, etc.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
Exploration: Descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to understand data distribution.
Distribution Fitting: Fitting data to statistical distributions (e.g., normal, Poisson, Gamma) and testing the fit.
Model Validation: Using cross-validation and goodness-of-fit tests to assess model reliability.
Output distribution includes:

Temperature: Often normal or log-normal distribution.
Precipitation: Typically Poisson or Gamma distribution.
Wind Speed: Often Weibull or Rayleigh distribution.
Extreme Events: Modeled using Gumbel or Generalized Extreme Value distributions.
These methods help in predicting weather patterns, assessing risks, and planning for events like extreme temperatures or rainfall.
